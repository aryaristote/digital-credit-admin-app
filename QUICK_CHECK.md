# Quick Check: Is Backend Running?

## Step 1: Check if Backend is Running

1. **Look at your backend terminal** (where you ran `npm run dev`)
2. **Do you see:**
   ```
   ðŸš€ Admin Application is running on: http://localhost:5430/api/v1
   ```

If you DON'T see this, the backend isn't running! Start it with:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## Step 2: When You Try to Login

**Look at the backend terminal** - You should see:

```
ðŸ“¥ [AUTH CONTROLLER] Received login request
ðŸ“§ [AUTH CONTROLLER] Email: admin@digitalcredit.com
ðŸ”„ Login attempt for: admin@digitalcredit.com
```

**If you don't see ANY logs**, the request isn't reaching the backend!

## Step 3: Check Backend Port

The backend should be running on **port 5430**, NOT port 3002.

Check your backend terminal for the port number.

## What to Do Now

1. **Check if backend terminal is open**
2. **Check if you see the startup message**
3. **When you login, check if you see ANY logs in backend terminal**
4. **Share what you see (or don't see) in the backend terminal**

This will tell us if the backend is even receiving the request!
