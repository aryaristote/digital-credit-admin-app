## 🎯 Critical Business Logic Implemented

### 1. **Credit Approval System** ✅
```
User requests credit → Check credit score
  ├─ Score ≥ 600 → AUTO-APPROVE
  │   ├─ 750+: 5% interest (Excellent)
  │   ├─ 700-749: 7.5% interest (Good)
  │   ├─ 650-699: 10% interest (Fair)
  │   └─ 600-649: 15% interest (Poor)
  └─ Score < 600 → AUTO-REJECT
```

### 2. **Credit Repayment System** ✅ ⭐ **SECURE**
```
User pays credit → Validate amount
  ├─ Check savings balance → MUST HAVE FUNDS
  ├─ Deduct from savings → Transaction recorded
  ├─ Apply to credit → Payment recorded
  └─ Check if complete → Update status
```

### 3. **Savings Account** ✅
```
Deposit → Validate amount → Record transaction → Update balance
Withdraw → Check balance → Validate → Record → Update
```

### 4. **Session Management** ✅
```
Login → Create session → Store refresh token (hashed)
Refresh → Validate session → Issue new tokens
Logout → Invalidate session
Logout All → Invalidate all user sessions
```
