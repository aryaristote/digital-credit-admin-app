# Port Fixed Locally

## Problem Found

The `backend/.env` file had `PORT=3002`, which overrides the default in the code.

## Fix Applied

Updated `backend/.env` from:

```
PORT=3002
```

To:

```
PORT=9000
```

## Next Steps

1. **Stop the local backend** (if running) - Press Ctrl+C
2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

Now the local backend will run on port **9000**!

## Summary

- Local backend: port 9000
- Docker backend: port 9000
- Frontend: port 9001

Everything is consistent now!
