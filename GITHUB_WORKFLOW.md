## 🌿 Branching Strategy (Professional Workflow)

### Main Branches

- `main` - Production-ready code (protected)
- `develop` - Development integration branch
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Urgent production fixes

### Create Development Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to develop branch
git checkout -b develop

# Push develop branch
git push -u origin develop
```

## 📝 Workflow for Future Changes

### For New Features

git commit -m "feat: add admin dashboard with analytics"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# 4. Create Pull Request on GitHub
# 5. Review and merge to develop
# 6. When ready for production, merge develop → main
```
